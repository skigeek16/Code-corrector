  "bug_type": "Logic Error",
  "explanation": "The bug occurs when the `hare` node's successor is `None`, the loop prematurely returns `False` without considering that the `tortoise` might also have reached the end of the list, causing an incorrect result for lists containing cycles.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Check if `tortoise` and `hare` have reached the end of the list separately with their own condition."
