  "buggy_line": "for i in range(a, b + 1 - k):",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The loop condition `range(a, b + 1 - k)` incorrectly calculates the range for `i`. The upper limit `b + 1 - k` does not ensure that the last `k` elements from the range `a` to `b` are included in the calculation.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the loop condition to `range(a, b - k + 2)` to ensure that the last `k` elements are included."
