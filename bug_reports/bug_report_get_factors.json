  "buggy_line": "return [i] + get_factors(n // i)",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The bug arises because the function does not ensure that the factors are added in a sorted order. When the function returns from a recursive call, it prepends the current factor `i` to the list of factors of `n // i`. This results in the list being correctly appended at each level of recursion, but not in a sorted order.",
  "fix_suggestion": "The function should collect all factors in a list and then sort the list at the end to ensure the factors are in sorted order. This can be done by using a list to gather all factors and sorting it before returning."
}
```

### Fix Suggestion Implementation:
```python
def get_factors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return []

    def collect_factors(n, factors):
        if n == 1:
            return factors

        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return collect_factors(n // i, factors + [i])

        return factors + [n]

    return sorted(collect_factors(n, []))

```

Explanation of the Fix:
1. Introduce an inner helper function `collect_factors` that takes an additional parameter `factors` to collect the prime factors.
2. Remove the base case of checking `n == 1` only once at the start to ensure it is skipped before collecting factors.
3. Collect factors in a list and recursively build the list until the base case is reached.
4. Finally, sort the collected factors in ascending order before returning the list. This ensures that the factors are returned in sorted order with repetition, maintaining the required property.
