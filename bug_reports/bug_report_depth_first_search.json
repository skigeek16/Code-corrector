  "bug_type": "AttributeError",
  "explanation": "The `node.successors` attribute should return a non-iterable collection.  However, `node.successors` will raise an AttributeError in context of loop iteration which you should iterate over the values in `node.successors` before passing them to `search_from`. The issue is that `node.successors` might not be iterable, leading the code to fail with an AttributeError.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Use node.successors.values() if successors is a dictionary-like collection or alternatively explicitly store node.successors in a list or set before iteration."
