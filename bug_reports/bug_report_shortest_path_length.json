  "buggy_line": "if node is goalnode:",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The comparison 'if node is goalnode:' uses the 'is' operator, which checks for object identity rather than value equality. This will not correctly identify when the node is the goal node because it checks for the same object in memory, not just the same value.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Use the '==' operator to compare the values of 'node' and 'goalnode'. The corrected line should be 'if node == goalnode:'."
