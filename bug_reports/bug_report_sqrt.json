  "buggy_line": "    while abs(x - approx) > epsilon:",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The condition in the while loop is comparing x with approx instead of comparing the square of approx with x. The correct condition should check if the square of approx is within epsilon of x.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the condition to `while abs(approx ** 2 - x) > epsilon:`"
}
```

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(approx ** 2 - x) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    return approx
```

This ensures that the loop continues until the square of `approx` is within `epsilon` of `x`, which is the correct implementation of the Newton-Raphson method for computing the square root.
