  "line_number": 14,
  "buggy_line": "for edge in result:",
  "bug_type": "SyntaxError",
  "explanation": "The code contains a trailing comma on the print statement, which is not necessary and can cause confusion. Nevertheless, the biggest issue here is that the `minimum_spanning_tree` function is assumed to return an iterable of edges, but it is not explicitly defined in the provided code. This could lead to a logical error if the function does not behave as expected.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Remove the trailing comma in the print statement and ensure that the `minimum_spanning_tree` function returns the expected format. Also, consider adding type hints and docstrings for better code clarity and maintenance."
