  "buggy_line": "next_perm = list(perm)",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The line `next_perm = list(perm)` is creating a shallow copy of the list `perm` rather than running operations directly on `perm`. It's unnecessary to use the returned next_perm because later a different returned statement fetches the changed 'perm' which isn't working since the original list cannot be reversed.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Simply manipulate the original list `perm` and find a way to neatly reverse the suffix"
}
