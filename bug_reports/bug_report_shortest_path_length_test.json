The bug in the `shortest_path_length_test` function is related to the handling of unreachable paths. The comment indicates that the expected output for the `unreachable` path (e.g., from `node1` to `node5`) is `INT_MAX`, but `INT_MAX` is not a predefined constant in Python. Instead, it should be represented using a large integer value or using `float('inf')`.

Here is the JSON representation of the bug analysis:

```json
{
  "line_number": 36,
  "buggy_line": "    result = shortest_path_length(length_by_edge, node1, node5)",
  "bug_type": "Expectation Mismatch",
  "explanation": "The comment expects the output to be INT_MAX, but this is not defined in the Python code. INT_MAX should be represented using a large integer or float('inf').",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the comments to use float('inf') for unreachable paths and update the comparison in the test code accordingly."
}
```

Additionally, to ensure the corrected code operates as expected, we could further consider checking the return type or ensuring correct functionality.

In the code, check the implementation of `shortest_path_length` to verify it returns `float('inf')` for unreachable paths.

**Fixed suggestion**:

update the comment block

```text
# Case 4: Unreachable path
# Output: float('inf')
```

If `shortest_path_length` uses `INT_MAX`, Modify its implementation to return `float('inf')` on unreachable paths.

It is also good practice to add explicit error checking and validation based on the shortest path algorithm expected use.
