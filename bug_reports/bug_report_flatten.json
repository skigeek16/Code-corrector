  "buggy_line": "yield flatten(x)",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The bug occurs in the line `yield flatten(x)`. In this line, the `flatten` function is being called, and its result is directly yielded. However, `flatten` is a generator, and yielding a generator generates a nested generator object. This is not the intended behavior because the intention is to yield the individual elements of the nested lists, it will fail with Statement incorrectly, then become a NOT TYPE object",
  "fix_suggestion": "Instead of yielding the entire generator, iterate over the elements of the generator yielded and produce values only when `x` is not a list. This can fix by using yield statement or with the concatenation of the generator. Changing the current not-flat sub-value `y` to `yield x` will help yield the end product individually."
