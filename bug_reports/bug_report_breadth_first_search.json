  "buggy_line": "            nodesseen.update(node.successors)",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The line `nodesseen.update(node.successors)` is incorrectly attempting to update the `nodesseen` set with the list of successors without considering that `nodes.successors` is an iterable but not a set. This may lead to incomplete tracking of visited nodes, which can cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop or miss the goal node.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change `nodesseen.update(node.successors)` to `nodesseen.update(o for o in node.successors)` to correctly update `nodesseen` with individual elements from `node.successors` iterable."
