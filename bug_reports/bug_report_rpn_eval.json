  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The order of operands `a` and `b` when popped from the stack is incorrect. The correct order should be `b` followed by `a` because Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expects the last operand to be popped first.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Swap the order of `a` and `b` when calling the `op` function to `stack.append(op(token, b, a))`."
