  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "This function calls the 'topological_ordering' function and prints the values during its execution. However, Node is a generic data type that doesn't always have a 'value' attribute. In this example, the attribute name for the value of the node is `data`",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change print( x.value ) to print( x.data )"
}
