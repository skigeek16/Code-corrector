  "buggy_line": "    row.append(upleft + upright)",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The bug arises because the current implementation does not handle the first element of each row correctly. The first element of each row in Pascal's Triangle should always be 1, but the code does not explicitly set this value. Instead, it calculates the sum of upleft and upright, which can result in incorrect values.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Add an explicit check to handle the case when c == 0. That changes row will append 1 when c == 0."
