  "buggy_line": "length_by_path[i, j] = min(length_by_path[i, j],length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k])",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The buggy line is incorrect because the Floyd-Warshall algorithm should update the path length by checking the path from i to j through k, but the current implementation incorrectly add the path length from j to k instead of i to k.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Correct the logical error by using `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[k, j]` instead of `length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]`."
