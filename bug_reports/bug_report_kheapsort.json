  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The loop iterates over the entire input list `arr`, which includes elements that have already been processed in the heap. This causes duplicate elements to be pushed into the heap, violating the preconditions that elements in `arr` are unique.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the loop to iterate only over the elements starting from index `k`, since the first `k` elements are already in the heap. Use `for x in arr[k:]` instead of `for x in arr`."
