  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The condition `any(n % p > 0 for p in primes)` checks if any prime divisor of `n` exists such that `n` is divisible by a prime. However, the logic should check if n is divisible by any of the primes in the list. This would yield false positives if n is a true prime.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Change the condition to `all(n % p != 0 for p in primes)` to check if `n` is not divisible by any prime number in the list, ensuring all non-prime numbers are filtered."
