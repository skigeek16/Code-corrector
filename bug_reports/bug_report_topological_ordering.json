  "buggy_line": "if set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:",
  "bug_type": "Logical Error",
  "explanation": "The condition `set(ordered_nodes).issuperset(nextnode.outgoing_nodes)` checks if all outgoing nodes of `nextnode` are already in `ordered_nodes`, but it does not ensure that `nextnode`s incoming nodes are properly processed. This can lead to incorrect topological ordering.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Instead of using `issuperset`, check if all incoming nodes of `nextnode` have been added to `ordered_nodes`. This ensures that `nextnode` can be safely added to the topological order."
}
```

To fix the bug, replace the problematic line with the following:

```python
if all(incoming in ordered_nodes for incoming in nextnode.incoming_nodes) and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
```

This ensures that `nextnode` is only added to `ordered_nodes` if all its incoming nodes have already been processed.
