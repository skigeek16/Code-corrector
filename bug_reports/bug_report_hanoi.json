  "bug_type": "logical_error",
  "explanation": "The expression ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop() incorrectly calculates the 'helper' peg. The subtraction operation between sets does not behave as expected. Subtracting sets removes elements present in the first set and none in the second.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Use a list to select an element other than start if it exists, or end if start does not exist."
