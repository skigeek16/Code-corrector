  "bug_type": "Off-by-one error",
  "explanation": "The bug occurs because the hi variable should be set to mid - 1 to properly narrow down the search range. Currently, hi is set to mid, which can cause an infinite loop or incorrect results because lo can become greater than hi without the loop body being entered.

    The goal is to search for the first occurrence of x in the sorted array arr. The body of the loop is designed to move the high and low pointers appropriately. However, setting hi to mid instead of mid - 1 can lead to a situation where lo never exceeds hi.

    For example, if arr = [1, 2, 3] and x = 2, the loop will go like this:
    1. Initial values: lo = 0, hi = 3
    2. mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1
    3. arr[mid] = 2, x == arr[1] so return mid
    However, if mid were set to mid - 1, the range of elements to search would be incorrect, because mid would always be set incorrectly leading to potentially infinite loop or skips
